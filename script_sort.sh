<<COMMENTS
Takes an ARGV argument (a filename), extracts the accuracy score
and conditionally sorts the model result file into one of two folders
(good_models/ or bad_models/).
(HINT: Use grep and cut to extract accuracy value from the files.
Use mathematical flags (-ge, -lt) for conditional sort.
Run your script_sort.sh for each text file as argument.)
